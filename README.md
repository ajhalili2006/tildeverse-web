## Contributing

Patches are always welcome, although you must sign-off your commits to comply with the Linux DCO.
Please be reminded that while this is a personal open-source project, please expect long waiting
times during pathc reviews and don't be disappointed when I disagree on stuff and chose not to merge
the patches for any reasons, including mental health breaks.
